The second set in the Skyrim block, Word at War sees Ulfric's Stormcloak rebels declare war on the greater Tamriel after a surprise victory in Skyrim's civil war. While the rest of the world nervously prepares for war, the remaining dragons go into hiding to avoid extermination at the hands of the dragonborn. Now fully realized, the dragonborn is remembered not by name but by the legacy they left behind.

This set is an inversion of the traditional draft format, with a more powerful cube style draft suplimented by common effects that function as deck smoothing cards. Five tri-color arcuns exist to guide the different archetypes.
